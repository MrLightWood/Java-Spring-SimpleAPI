    // What is gradle wrapper? Why are we using it instead of gradle?
    // Answer: It is a script that runs Gradle tasks with a declared version. So, it means that our project can be distributed to public and
    // people who downloads it will be using the same Gradle's build, compile and install functionality. It will be launched even if a user
    // does not have Gradle installed on his PC. We are using it to ensure the same Gradle functionality on all PCs where it will be launched
