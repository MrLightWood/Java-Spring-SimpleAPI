    //  The course is coming to an end and I would like you to tell me how did it go

    //todo A
    // On the scale 1 to 10 how useless or useful this course was with 1 being very useless and 10 being very useful?
    //For me, who does not have much great experience or skills in programming, this course was quite normal if I can talk about its difficulty.
    // I will rate this course as 10 :)

    //todo B
    // Write some things you liked? At least 1, but you can write more.
    //Having a team got me the most, especially in times when your brain can not acknowledge certain information about the code or topic itself,
    //they gladly offered me a help, as well as I did my best to help them too. I hope so at least.

    //todo C
    // Write some things you didn't like? At least 1, but you can write more.
    //I do not think, that there is any great oe even minor problem I have encountered during the course to critisize it.
    //It may be somehow difficult at first to deal with GitLab, however it is a necessary measure afterwards. Moreover,
    //necessary video materials were provided as well.

    //todo D
    // Anything else to add? Comments? What to do differently next year? (optional)
    //
    //As I have mentioned in previous comments, I could not think of any more solutions to make your course even better.
