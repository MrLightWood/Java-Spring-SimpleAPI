    //  The course is coming to an end and I would like you to tell me how did it go
    //  I use Python for most of my work last times and it was a bit challenging to use lower programming level and define types of variables,
    //  function parameters, and return value types. So, I had a bit of nostalgia.

    //todo A
    // On the scale 1 to 10 how useless or useful this course was with 1 being very useless and 10 being very useful?
    // 9

    //todo B
    // Write some things you liked? At least 1, but you can write more.
    // Jokes xD (Specially, "Is this Estonia we wanted? Is this education we needed?...")
    // I used git a looooot. I remember for some lesson I even uploaded works via Google Chrome, but this time there was no other way except terminal

    //todo C
    // Write some things you didn't like? At least 1, but you can write more.
    // I think the course could be a bit hard for those, who did not know about web services at all. Fortunately, I used Python-Django WEB framework
    // and knew about MVC.

    //todo D
    // Anything else to add? Comments? What to do differently next year? (optional)
    //
